# One-Time Token (OTT) Authentication System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **One-Time Token (OTT) Authentication System** using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Security**. The system generates a unique token for users upon request, sends it via email, and allows them to authenticate using a magic link containing the token. This approach enhances security by enabling passwordless login.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **User Initiates Request:**
   - The user requests a login via the OTT endpoint.
   
2. **Token Generation:**
   - A unique one-time token is generated.
   
3. **Magic Link Creation:**
   - The token is embedded in a URL, forming a magic link.

4. **Email Notification:**
   - The link is sent to the user's email using Spring Boot's email service.

5. **User Authentication:**
   - The user clicks the link, and the server validates the token.
   
6. **Secure Access:**
   - Once authenticated, the user gains access to the application.
